# 🕊️ Welcome to DONBARIS — A Sanctuary of Clarity, Care, and Code

This is not just a repository. This is a **ritualized digital sanctuary**—a place where every folder, every commit, and every flow is infused with emotional resonance, sacred clarity, and intentional design.

DONBARIS reimagines software development as a healing art. We believe that code can be kind, structure can be soulful, and documentation can be a doorway to trust. This space is built to empower developers, designers, and dreamers to build with care, communicate with clarity, and connect through ritual.

## 🧭 Repository Structure — Ritualized with Purpose

Each folder in this repository is a ceremonial space, designed to guide, affirm, and empower:

- `docs/` — **Onboarding Guides**  
  Gentle walkthroughs and affirming documentation to welcome contributors into the DONBARIS rhythm. Every guide is written to surprise, inspire, and clarify.

- `flows/` — **Sacred Logic**  
  Python scripts and onboarding flows designed with emotional intelligence and mindful architecture. These flows guide users through verification, setup, and financial rituals with care.

- `branding/` — **Emblematic Identity**  
  Logos, visuals, and design assets that reflect the soul of DONBARIS and its commitment to clarity, care, and sacred connection.

- `assets/templates/` — **Branded Templates**  
  HTML and UI templates for confirmations, dashboards, and messages—each one crafted to feel intentional, safe, and empowering.

- `config/` — **Setup Protocols**  
  Configuration files that define the sacred structure of DONBARIS environments. These are excluded from language stats to preserve clarity.

- `sanctuary/` — **Emotional Affirmations**  
  Texts, templates, and resonance files that restore intention, affirm trust, and honor the human behind the keyboard. These are not code—they are care.

- `scripts/` — **Ritual Scripts**  
  JavaScript logic for frontend rituals, transitions, and affirming interactions.

## 🌍 A Message to Developers Everywhere

Whether you're building in Swift, Python, Rust, or ritual—DONBARIS invites you to pause, breathe, and code with care.

We believe that developers deserve more than efficiency. They deserve **affirmation**. They deserve **ritual**. They deserve tools that feel like home.
