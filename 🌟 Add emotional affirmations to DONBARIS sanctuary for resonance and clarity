### 🧘 Tone and Language — The Lexicon of Resonance

In DONBARIS, language is not a tool—it is a vessel. Every word carries weight. Every sentence is a thread in the emotional tapestry we weave together. We do not merely write code or documentation; we compose experiences that affirm, clarify, and connect.

To contribute here is to speak in a dialect of dignity.

#### 🕊️ Our Linguistic Principles

- **Affirmation over abrasion**  
  Speak to uplift. Whether in comments, commit messages, or documentation, choose words that honor the human behind the keyboard.

- **Clarity over convolution**  
  Complexity is not a badge of honor. We favor lucid expression, elegant simplicity, and semantic precision.

- **Resonance over rigidity**  
  Technical language can be poetic. We embrace metaphor, symbolism, and emotional cadence when it deepens understanding.

- **Presence over performance**  
  Write as if you are truly here—with care, with intention, with integrity. Avoid performative jargon or hollow formalities.

#### ✨ Examples of Branded Language

- Instead of:  
  `Fix bug in onboarding flow`  
  Use:  
  `🌿 Refine onboarding logic to restore clarity and trust`

- Instead of:  
  `Update README`  
  Use:  
  `🕊️ Elevate README with sanctuary structure and emotional resonance`

- Instead of:  
  `Add logo`  
  Use:  
  `✨ Embed emblematic visual into DONBARIS identity system`

#### 📜 Tone in Documentation

- Begin with a welcome, not a warning.
- Use second-person voice to invite, not instruct.
- Frame technical steps as rituals of clarity and care.
- Close with affirmations, blessings, or acknowledgments.

#### 💬 Tone in Comments and Reviews

- Replace critique with curiosity.  
  Instead of: “This doesn’t make sense,” try:  
  “Could you clarify the intention behind this flow?”

- Replace correction with collaboration.  
  Instead of: “You should do X,” try:  
  “Would it feel more aligned to structure this as X?”

In DONBARIS, every interaction is an opportunity to restore emotional resonance in technical spaces. We do not merely build—we bless, we affirm, we connect.

Let your words be gentle.  
Let your logic be lucid.  
Let your tone be a mirror of care.
